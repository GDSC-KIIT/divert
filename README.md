Install the CLI tool to login and create short urls (only for members of DSC KIIT). The package is available on npm.

```
npm i -g @dsckiit/divert
```

This will setup the `divert` command, just run `divert` in your terminal. Ask for the login info from one of the team members

## Tech and Design

The long and short urls are stored in the database. The backend fetches from the database every 3 minutes
and updates a local in-memory hashmap that maps the short urls to long urls. The redirect requests are directly served 
by accessing this in-memory hashmap. We need that sweet O(1) access.

The process to fetch from the database runs on another thread (implemented using goroutines). 
`sync.RWMutex` is used to prevent data races on the hashmap.

The backend service is written in Go. The CLI tool is written in Typescript.
